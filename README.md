# EV_project

This code is the implement of repeated column generation algorithm (RCGA) for optimal scheduling of electric vehicle charging. 

We use open-source linear programming solver COIN-OR CLP to solve the part of linear programming in RCGA.

If you would like to implement this code, please first build COIN-OR CLP in your device. (We recommend compiling CLP from source not directly using binaries.)

Please configure 'CMakeLists.txt' according to your path of CLP.
